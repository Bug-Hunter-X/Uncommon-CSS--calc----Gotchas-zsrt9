The corrected CSS code is shown below, addressing the issues mentioned above:

```css
/* Corrected CSS */
width: calc(100% - 50px);

width: calc(50% + 100px);

width:calc(calc(100% - 50px) - 20px);

margin: calc((10px + 20px) / 2);

@media (min-width: 768px){
width:calc(100% - 50px);
}
```

Key improvements:

* **Spaces around operators:**  Spaces are added around the `-` operator in `calc(100% - 50px)`
* **Units consistency:** Units are consistent within each expression
* **Parentheses balance:** Parentheses are balanced and correctly placed. 
* **Browser compatibility testing:** The corrected CSS should be thoroughly tested across different browsers. 
* **Handling of floats:**  For more predictable outcomes when dealing with floating-point numbers, consider using a rounding function. 
* **Media query correctness:** The usage of `calc()` within media queries is reviewed for correctness.
